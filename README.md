# LazyFill

A quick Chrome extension I made because sometimes, I am too lazy to type the same things over and over again. 
Associates certain phrases (e.g. your email address) to certain key bindings so it fills in the field. Think of it as a Ctrl+V for special pre-determined texts. 

Sure, this is a working Chrome extension, but it is something barebones that I put together (while also trying to learn JavaScript).
Rather, use this as a skeleton for creating your own shortcuts. 

## Usage
Utilize the Manifest file to pick your key bindings.

Utilize ```content.json``` to match text to your keybinding. Obviously, don't use this for your passwords or sensitive information.
